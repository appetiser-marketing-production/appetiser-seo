## 2. End User Operations

### A. Features & Capabilities

1. **Link Handler**  
   Automatically adds `target="_blank"` and `rel="nofollow"` to links inside single blog posts.  
   This ensures that all links open in a new tab and external links are flagged for SEO, helping reduce bounce and preserve link equity. You can exclude specific domains from the `nofollow` rule via a customizable exclusion list.

2. **Robots.txt Editor**  
   Quickly view and edit your site’s `robots.txt` file from the dashboard.  
   You can reset to the default WordPress `robots.txt` rules or revert to the previously saved version with one click — ideal for managing how search engines index your site.

3. **.htaccess Editor**  
   Edit your site’s `.htaccess` file directly from the admin panel with built-in safety.  
   This feature lets you add redirects, rewrites, or access rules, with options to restore the default WordPress `.htaccess` or revert to the last version you saved.

4. **404 Monitor**  
   Track all 404 (Not Found) errors generated by visitors.  
   Each missing URL is logged with the time of request, IP address, and referring page. A clear viewer and "Clear Log" button help manage and clean up entries.

5. **Automated Blog Schema Generator**  
   Automatically generates valid JSON-LD (`BlogPosting`) schema for each published blog post.  
   It uses the post title, Yoast description (or fallback), featured image, author, and publish/modified dates. If a schema already exists, it updates the title, description, and date fields to stay SEO-friendly.

---

### B. Limitations / Known Constraints

1. Link handling – The plugin will not modify hardcoded `target` or `rel` attributes.  
2. Blog schema – If a post already has schema, only the title, description, and dates are updated.  
3. 404 Monitor – 404 logs are triggered only when the WordPress 404 template is loaded.
